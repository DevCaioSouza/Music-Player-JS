# Music-Player-JS
Music Player made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Hello! This is my first music player project, i'm glad to share it.
For now i'm fine maintaining the original code, which i got in a tutorial, 
so none of current functionalities were made by me. The intent here is just
to get used to basic functions and programming logic that these projects help
a begginer to learn and get better at coding.

But i seek to make changes to this page, and suggestions are accepted!
Thanks!!
